4 Jan 2022:
Having a significant number of issues. I can't convert the model to tflite for mobile use because of some tensor shapes. I'm not sure if this something I can fix easily let alone at all.

There are a few potential solutions:
    1) Look for another model that is proven to work on tflite
    2) Custom tflite conversion script - don't know if this is possible
